# Phonepe_data_visualization

## Overview

The project aims to analyze and visualize the data from PhonePe using tools like Google Colab, Pycharm, SQLite3, and Streamlit dashboard. The main goal is to provide both developers and users with insights into the data collected.

## 1. Introduction

The PhonePe Data Visualization project aims to analyze and visualize data collected by PhonePe to provide valuable insights. The project leverages Google Colab for data cleaning, Pycharm for development, SQLite3 for the database, and Streamlit for creating interactive dashboards.

## 2. Technologies Used

The project utilizes the following tools and technologies:

- Google Colab: A cloud-based platform used for data cleaning and exploration.
- Pycharm: An integrated development environment (IDE) used for writing code and managing the project.
- SQLite3: A lightweight, serverless database used to store and manage the PhonePe data.
- Streamlit: A Python library used to create interactive web applications for presenting data.

## 3. Data Cleaning

The data cleaning process was performed in Google Colab. Colab provides an interactive environment with built-in libraries, making it ideal for data cleaning tasks. The cleaning process involved:

- Loading the raw data into Colab.
- Handling missing or inconsistent data.
- Removing duplicate entries.
- Transforming data into a usable format.

The cleaned data is then stored in an SQLite3 database for easy access.

## 4. Database Connection

The SQLite3 database stores the cleaned data and allows easy retrieval for analysis. The connection to the database is established within the Pycharm environment using the `sqlite3` module. This ensures that the Streamlit dashboard can access the data and present it in an interactive manner.

To establish a database connection:

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to the SQLite3 database file
conn = sqlite3.connect('phonepe_data.db')
```

## 5. Streamlit Dashboard

The core of this project is the Streamlit dashboard, which provides an interactive interface for users to visualize the PhonePe data. The dashboard allows users to customize and filter the visualizations according to their preferences.

To run the Streamlit dashboard:

1. Install the required libraries: Ensure you have all the dependencies by running `pip install streamlit sqlite3 pandas`.

2. Clone the repository: Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine.

3. Run the app: In your Pycharm environment, use the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

4. The dashboard should now be accessible locally at `http://localhost:8501`.

## 6. Data Visualizations

The Streamlit dashboard provides various visualizations to understand the PhonePe data better. Some of the visualizations include:

- Line chart: Visualizing trends in transactions over time.
- Bar chart: Comparing transaction volumes across different categories.
- Pie chart: Illustrating the percentage distribution of transaction types.
- Scatter plot: Analyzing the relationship between transaction amount and frequency.

## 7. Contributing

We welcome contributions to the PhonePe Data Visualization project. If you want to submit bug reports, feature requests, or code contributions, please follow the guidelines outlined in the project's repository.

## 8. Issues

If you encounter any issues while using the application or have any suggestions for improvement, please visit the [issue tracker on GitHub](https://github.com/yourusername/phonepe-data-visualization/issues) to check if it's already reported. If not, feel free to open a new issue.

## 9. Future Improvements

We have several ideas for future improvements to enhance the PhonePe Data Visualization project:

- Implementing real-time data updates and live visualizations.
- Adding more advanced data filters and customization options.
- Supporting multiple databases for flexibility.
